		#SASS-Sun-Description = <<Sun>> is the most well known object in the daytime sky. Scientists have noted a particular burning sensation and potential loss of vision if it is stared at for long periods of time. This is especially important to keep in mind considering the effect shiny objects have on the average person.
		#SASS-Mercury-Description = <<Mercury>> figures in different mythologies as a fiery place with oceans of flowing lava. In reality however, it's much less interesting. Scientists speculate about possible ways to make it "awesome like in the stories". Some of those ideas have led to new breakthroughs in aerospace technology.
		#SASS-Venus-Description = <<Venus>> is certainly the yellowest object in the solar system. It's one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very yellow tint. It is considered by some to be almost a sister planet to <<Earth>>. Well, despite the yellow, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures. Actually, it's not very similar at all is it? Who are those people?
		#SASS-Earth-Description = A unique world, <<Earth>> has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. It has just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable population of astronauts, engineers, and snack-manufacturers. Reaching a stable orbit around <<Earth>> is one of the first things budding space programs strive for. It is said that he who can get his ship into orbit is halfway to anywhere.
		#SASS-Moon-Description = <<Moon>>, is a large satellite orbiting <<Earth>>. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. <<Moon>>'s discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of science. Granted, it didn't happen all that long ago, but it's still fair to say everyone is wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#SASS-Mars-Description = Also known as the red dot that you can see if you squint at it really hard, <<Mars>> has long been a wonder to atronomers. The planet has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the green color of <<Earth>>'s land.
		#SASS-Phobos-Description = <<Phobos>> has such a low gravity that landing on it is a very peculiar experience. Most of the times a landing on your nose is what you call 'a failure'. Here you would call it 'almost a failure'.
		#SASS-Deimos-Description = When a fantasy novel was published describing two moons of <<Mars>>, astronomers went to check and they discovered <<Phobos>> and <<Deimos>>. The two moons are orbiting almost exactly where described in Part 3 - Chapter 3 of the novel.
		#SASS-Vesta-Description = After finding a dwarf planet in the same region of <<Ceres>> it was proposed that the two objects could be remnants of a destroyed body. <<Vesta>> was found exactly where the orbits of the two bodies intersect. This was a huge coincidence since the second dwarf planet never actually existed. The astronomer who made the discovery was just reading the sky chart wrong and was watching at <<Ceres>> the whole time.
		#SASS-Ceres-Description = <<Ceres>> is a very small planet. It was the first planet considered to be a dwarf. Its orbit is highly irregular and together with its size it took a long time to discover since half the time it was not where scientists expected to find a planet. Due to its nature of frequenting the bad parts of space, this dwarf planet was officially labeled as "Not to be trusted" by the scientific community.
		#SASS-Jupiter-Description = <<Jupiter>> is particularly known for being a rather large planet. Every astronaut has longed to visit this gas giant since the moment it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its unmatched size. If you look at <<Jupiter>> through a telescope, it is fuzzy.
		#SASS-Io-Description = When first discovered, <<Io>> was thought to be a storm of <<Jupiter>>'s atmosphere. When someone decided to actually record the position of the smudge, it was discovered that <<Io>> is actually one of several objects orbiting around <<Jupiter>>. The Great Red Spot Hoax has since become a recurrent joke between astronomers all over <<Earth>>.
		#SASS-Europa-Description = Since the day a strange signal was detected near <<Jupiter>>, the attention of all astronomers has been focused on <<Europa>>. A mission to land on this moon has been in development ever since. The project is still being funded to this date, even if a more detailed data analysis unveiled that the signal from <<Jupiter>> was actually just static from the toaster.
		#SASS-Ganymede-Description = <<Ganymede>> was among the first moons to be discovered around any planet other than <<Earth>>. The discovery of the satellites around <<Jupiter>> provided a final proof that <<Earth>> was not the center of the universe. If there are things going around <<Jupiter>>, philosophers reasoned, they can't be going around <<Earth>>.
		#SASS-Callisto-Description = When <<Callisto>> was first discovered, it was not entered into records because the scientist in charge thought this moon wasn't really important. The reasoning was that since <<Callisto>>'s orbit does not resonate with the orbits of the other major moons of <<Jupiter>> nobody will notice if it's missing. Ultimately it was decided to include <<Callisto>> and leave out <b><i><404_NAME_NOT_FOUND></i></b> instead.
		#SASS-Saturn-Description = <<Saturn>> has been elected the prettiest planet in the Solar System. Not only is it the only planet with such beautiful rings, but its high rotation speed also gives it a very peculiar shape. <<Saturn>>'s very low density is just below that of <Iron> making it theoretically possible for the gas giant to float on <<Earth>>'s ocean.
		#SASS-Iron-RealSize = water
		#SASS-Iron-StockSize = iron
		#SASS-Prometheus-Description = <<Prometheus>> is best known for being a sheperd moon for one of <<Saturn>>'s rings. Since it is a well known fact that each ring needs two sheperd bodies, astronomers are still looking for <<Prometheus>>'s companion. This moon is very elongated and has a rough pecked surface.
		#SASS-Titan-Description = <<Titan>> has been voted the most <<Earth>> like moon in the solar system. It has an atmosphere, seas, lakes and rivers. Unfortunately, preliminary results seem to exclude the possibility of exploiting this rich environment for snack-manufacturing purposes.
		#SASS-Iapetus-Description = When a strange signal was detected near <<Saturn>>, the attention of all astronomers focused on <<Iapetus>>. Philosophers speculate that the peculiar walnut shape of the moon could be artificial in nature, and propose to monitor the body more closely. The signal was later determined to originate near <<Jupiter>>, shifting the focus of astronomers to that system.
		#SASS-Uranus-Description = When <<Uranus>> was first discovered it was thought to be a star, it was even entered in the catalogs as a star for a few months under the name "Royal Star". When it was discovered that <<Uranus>> was in fact a planet, in order to avoid silly jokes being made about calling the planet a "star", the scientific community decided to change its name to "<<Uranus>>" which was perceived to be less silly at the time.
		#SASS-Miranda-Description = <<Miranda>> is famous amongst astronomers for its extremely varied topography. According to legend, the moon is a chewed gumball that the giant named <<Uranus>> spit into space once all the flavour was gone.
		#SASS-Sycorax-Description = Philosophers argue that <<Sycorax>> must have some kind of quarrel with the other moons of <<Uranus>> since it orbits the gas giant in the opposite direction. Scientists don't give much credit to this hypotesis because no direct evidence has been obtained on the matter.
		#SASS-Titania-Description = <<Titania>> is a fairly regular moon. It was discovered by an astronomer that fell asleep during a warm solstice night at the telescope. After dreaming the daughter of <<Titan>>, the astronomer woke up to the sight of the biggest moon of <<Uranus>> and named it <<Titania>>.
		#SASS-Neptune-Description = <<Neptune>> was discovered completely by accident. An astronomer was having issues getting good pictures of <<Uranus>> because the background color was way off. After careful calculation, a completely empty patch of the sky was chosen to reset the black balance of the instrumentation. Once the telescope was pointed to this position, astronomers were staggered to find there a deep blue ice giant.
		#SASS-Proteus-Description = <<Proteus>> is the largest of the regular prograde satellites of <<Neptune>>. Admittedly, the fact that the gas giant has only one regular prograde moon, greatly undermines the importance of this trait.
		#SASS-Triton-Description = Scientists believe that <<Triton>> was once part of a binary system that dissociated when it encountered <<Neptune>>. <<Triton>> became bound to the gas giant while the other body, supposedly <<Pluto>>, was expelled and moved on, probably looking for another partner.
		#SASS-Nereid-Description = You need three moons to tell the story of <<Neptune>>: <<Proteus>>, <<Triton>> and <<Nereid>>. The main reason being that <<Neptune>> only has three moons.
		#SASS-Pluto-Description = When <<Pluto>> was discovered it was promptly labeled the ninth planet of the Solar System. When contracts started to show up for manned missions on this planet the status of <<Pluto>> was quickly changed to dwarf planet in order to dampen the interest towards the body. No astronaut wants to go so far away from any known source of snacks, and nobody likes <<Pluto>> anyways.
		#SASS-Charon-Description = For years <<Pluto>> was thought to be a lone dwarf planet with a huge bulge sticking out on one side called "<<Charon>> mons". Astronomers eventually realized that what they thought was just a mountain was in fact another dwarf planet. They quickly pointed out how "mons" is pretty close to "moons" making it a fairly easy mistake to make.
		#SASS-Haumea-Description = Naming and formal acceptance of <<Haumea>> were delayed several years due to controversy about the discovery of this dwarf planet. Astronomers have become rather skeptic when food-shaped celestial bodies are submitted to the science archives and believed this was just a prank untill they carefully analyzed the provided data.
