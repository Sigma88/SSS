# *Stock-alike Solar System*

## System Description

This mod rearranges bodies from other mods to reproduce the Solar System but with a Kerbal style.

Each body has the same surface gravity, but 1/10th of the radius compared to their real life counterpart.

Currently there are:

- 4 Terrestrial Planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)
- 4 Gas Giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
- 16 Moons (Moon, Phobos & Deimos, 4 Jovians, 3 Saturnians, 3 Uranians, and 3 Neptunians)
- 5 Dwarf Planets (Vesta, Ceres, Pluto, Charon, Haumea)
- 2 Asteroid belts (Main Belt and Kuiper Belt)
- 2 Groups of Trojan asteroids at Jupiter's L4 and L5
- 2 Asteroid moons orbiting Haumea (Hiʻiaka and Namaka)
- A certain amount of Easter Eggs

## Settings

You can activate any of them in the Settings.cfg file you find in the StockalikeSolarSystem folder.
