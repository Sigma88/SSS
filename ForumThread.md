# *Stock-alike Solar System*

Kopernicus is a wonderful mod, and there are a lot of great planets out there.<br>
This mod will rearrange bodies from many different planet packs<br>
in order to create a Kerbal analogue of the Real Solar System<br>

## System Description

This mod rearranges bodies from other mods to reproduce the Solar System but with a Kerbal style.

Each body has the same surface gravity, but 1/10th of the radius compared to their real life counterpart.

Currently there are:

- 4 Terrestrial Planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars)
- 4 Gas Giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
- 16 Moons (Moon, Phobos & Deimos, 4 Jovians, 3 Saturnians, 3 Uranians, and 3 Neptunians)
- 5 Dwarf Planets (Vesta, Ceres, Pluto, Charon, Haumea)
- 2 Asteroid belts (Main Belt and Kuiper Belt)
- 2 Groups of Trojan asteroids at Jupiter's L4 and L5
- 2 Asteroid moons orbiting Haumea (Hiʻiaka and Namaka)
- A certain amount of Easter Eggs

## Settings

This mod comes with three optional settings, all off by default.

You can activate any of them in the Settings.cfg file you find in the StockalikeSolarSystem folder.

- **KerbalizedNames** - Gives all bodies stockalike names
- **RealSizeSystem** - Gives all bodies the same size as their real life counterpart
- **UranusTilt** - Gives Uranus 90° Axial tilt

## Easter Eggs

Stock-alike Solar System features a certain number of easter eggs.
When you open the spoiler down here, you will find other spoilers (one per easter egg) with a small description of the location so you can choose which easter egg to look at.
Inside the spoiler of each easter egg you will find more detailed information about the location of the easter egg, pictures and an explanation of what the easter egg is.
If you find an easter egg in game, or you decide to look at this list, please don't spoil the surprise for other players.
If you want to post about an easter egg in the thread, hide everything inside a spoiler and put a warning outside so that people know that there are easter egg informations inside the spoiler.
